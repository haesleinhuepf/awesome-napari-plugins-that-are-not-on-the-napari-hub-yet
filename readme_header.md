This is a curated list of napari plugins, that are open-source but not on the [napari-hub](https://napari-hub.org) just (yet). The intention of this list is to guide developers and users who want to find out if certain plugins exist already and/or are under development. Many of these plugins are under active development and thus, not available via [pypi](https://pypi.org/) and the [napari-hub](https://napari-hub.org) yet. Some other plugins were decommissioned and are no longer developed. This list provides links to these valuable resources so that others can learn from the code, resurrect useful functionality and don't have to start from scratch. Another intention is to motivate developers to work together on plugins and contribute to active projects, instead of developing similar plugins in parallel.

Contributions to the list are very welcome. If you want to add an entry to this list or modify a description or link for example, please modify the `list.csv` file in a fork of this repository and send a pull-request. If you are new to pull-requests, you may be interested in this [blog post](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2021/09/04/collaborative-bio-image-analysis-script-editing-with-git/).

The list is sorted alphabetically.
